      <h2>Why I prefer to be alone. . .</h2>
      <h5></h5>
      <p>It wasn't the same since the beginning. It just the circumstances, our mistakes, our failures, and our success
      and society's view towards us preferentially shapes our personality. I think every single thing that happens in our day to day like how we handle situations, how we overcome society's comments and
      how we perceive things are majorly responsible for what we choose to accept as reality or simply ignore it
      . Things are quite similar but little
      twisty and salty in my case.</p>
      <p>It's not good or I think not possible to explain here why I prefer to be alone. But being alone has it's own perks.
      It allows us to think much deeply on every probalistic possibilities and different relative perspctives leaving us with infinite number of
      conclusions that sometimes makes no sense. But it worth at the end. I taught myself in this way. Maybe i'm not perfect , doesn't have
       lot of friends but atleast I know the reality of this external world, I know how to handle situations wisely and above all I know what I am
        and always be satisfied with it.</p>

      <h2>Other habits. . .</h2>
      <p>I love to read about philosophy and cosmology. The more I read the more I get trapped in the infinite darkness of cosmic symphony and
       it felt so real that I can sit the whole night staring the night sky almost thinking about nothing just feeling the vibrations of cosmic
        marvels twinkling above. This gives birth to another habit of watching sci-fi movies which breaks every natural law there exists and pushes
        my imagination even beyond breaking all boundaries of my thinking capacity. </p>
      <p>I somehow developed an interest in coding while I was in class 9 due to many reasons not worth discussing here.
      I am so fond of it that by now I have completed more than 500 programs of every level. It also enhances my problem-solving and algorithmic skills. Though
      major areas of study in this field yet to come.</p>
      <p>With the passing of every single day of my life I can proudly say, "Today I learn."</p>
