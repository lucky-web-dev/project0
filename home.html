      <h2>Childhood anomalies...</h2>
      <h5></h5>
      <p>As usual, I was born as a normal guy. My parents were proud to have me though I was missing "dormamu"
      . However, on day0 of my life I hardly recognize them 'cause I loved to "sleep and weep" all day long.</p>
      <p>It goes on until day60 when my eyes were able to transmit electric signals via optic nerves to my brain and
      I realized that I had achieved visual preception. Yeah! I know I was smart. As much as I remember the first thing I saw
      was my sister's face staring at me whistling something like ,"lalla lalla loori....." I waved her. I shyed  a bit.
      Still figuring out what she replied.
      That's all I remember about my childhood.</p>
      <br>
      <h2>School life...</h2>
      <p>Honestly speaking, I never attended preschool. My mom worked out a very good teacher as well as a mentor for me. My schooling started from LKG from a very ordinary schooling
      and studied there upto class 5.Although I do not remember what I learned from this school but that time was very peaceful, joyful and best part of my life.</p>
      <p>Then for further education I moved to a nearby certified school, S. J. EDUCATION CENTER. Though the time I spend in this school was not good but it helped me learning the best lessons
      of life and it majorly shaped my personality. Early this year, 2020, I completed my 12 from this school but the exams were gone really bad.</p>
      <h2>Personal life...</h2>
      <p class="text-danger">Sorry I cann't reveal that publically, it's quite personal!!!</p>
